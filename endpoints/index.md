Outgoing Mobilities Index endpoint
==================================

* [What is the status of this document?][statuses]
* [See the index of all other EWP Specifications][develhub]


Summary
-------

This endpoint allows the receiving institution to access a list of all
mobilities it can read on the sending institution's server.


Request method
--------------

 * Requests MUST be made with either HTTP GET or HTTP POST method. Servers MUST
   support both these methods. Servers SHOULD reject all other request methods.

 * Clients are advised to use POST when passing large number of parameters
   (servers MAY set a limit on their GET query string length).


Request parameters
------------------

Parameters MUST be provided in the regular `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
format.


### `sending_hei_id` (required)

An identifier of the institution which is the sending partner of the
mobilities. This parameter MUST be required by the server even if it covers
only a single institution. It is *not* repeatable.

**By default**, the server returns all mobilities the requester *has access to*
(regardless of their receiving partner, arrival date, nor status). This
includes very old mobilities, and the cancelled ones.


### `receiving_hei_id` (repeatable, optional)

A list of institution identifiers. If given, then the results returned MUST
contain only those mobilities whose receiving institution matches **at least
one** of the given `receiving_hei_id` identifiers.

This parameter is *repeatable*, so the request MAY contain multiple occurrences
of it. The server is REQUIRED to process all of them.


### `receiving_academic_year_id` (optional)

An academic year identifier, in the `YYYY/YYYY` format, as defined in the
[EWP Academic Term Data Types](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-types-academic-term)
document. If given, then the server MUST return only such mobilities which
have taken place (or are planned to take place) during this single academic
year.

This parameter was added to allow the client to synchronize only a smaller
subset of all mobilities more easily (because many clients don't want to store
mobilities which have ended long ago).


### `modified_since` (optional)

A datetime string in the [`xs:dateTime` format][xs-datetime], e.g.
`2004-02-12T15:19:21+01:00`.

If given, then the server SHOULD filter the returned mobility IDs to the ones
which have been either created or modified after the given point in time.

 * Servers MAY include mobilities which were *not* modified. For example, if
   the server only *suspects* that the mobility has been modified, then it is
   okay to include such mobility's ID in the response.

 * As we previously explained [here][index-pulling], clients MAY use the
   `index` and `get` endpoints as a pull-based method of synchronization,
   alternative (or rather complementary) to CNRs. It is RECOMMENDED for the
   servers to support this parameter, to avoid unnecessary network traffic.


Permissions
-----------

Only selected Outgoing Mobility objects should be accessible to the caller.
Visibility of objects SHOULD be kept in sync with the visibility described in
the `get` endpoint. That is:

 * Servers MUST publish IDs of every mobility which is accessible (to the same
   caller) via the `get` endpoint.

 * Server MUST NOT publish IDs of objects which would NOT be accessible (to the
   same caller) via its `get` endpoint. Clients which receive mobility IDs from
   the `index` endpoint should be able to fetch all objects referenced by those
   IDs.


Handling of invalid parameters
------------------------------

 * General [error handling rules][error-handling] apply.

 * Note, that parameters are "AND-ed" together, but their values are "OR-ed".
   This means that invalid or unknown values provided in `sending_hei_id` and
   `receiving_hei_id` parameters MUST be **allowed** (but **not ignored**) by
   the server.

   The difference between "being allowed" and "being ignored" becomes clear
   once you try to analyze the scenario when one of these lists contains
   **only** such IDs which are unknown to the server. The server MUST respond
   with an empty `<response>` element in this case, regardless of all the other
   parameters. For example:

   * `?sending_hei_id=known&receiving_hei_id=known&receiving_hei_id=UNKNOWN`
     will return some results,
   * `?sending_hei_id=known&receiving_hei_id=known` will return exactly the
     same results,
   * `?sending_hei_id=known&receiving_hei_id=UNKNOWN` will **NEVER** return any
     results,
   * `?sending_hei_id=known` will return results again (but not necessarily the
     same results as the ones returned in the first two bullets).


Response
--------

Servers MUST respond with a valid XML document described by the
[index-response.xsd](index-response.xsd) schema. See the schema annotations
for further information.
